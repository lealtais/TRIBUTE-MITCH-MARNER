    <h2>Career Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Mitch Marner, born in Markham, Ontario, became a beacon of hope for Leafs fans. Drafted by Toronto, he brought electrifying playmaking, heart, and joy to the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mitch starts his career with the Leafs in 2015 when he is drafted to be a winger. 

    He was more than a pleasure to be a player for the Leafs, he had been a big fan of at Leafs his entire life, and the biggest dream of his life  had just come true. 

    <p>
        “It was kind of a surprise when Toronto called my name but it was a great delight, was better than what I expected it to be. I never thought when I was a little kid sitting in front of my television with my Leafs jersey on that I’d get a chance to put it on in a professional way and go out and play for my city. I’ve been given that opportunity now and it’s up to me to make the most of it.”
    <p>
        Marner Said about being draftef for the Leafs. 
    </p>
</p>
        
    </p>
    <p>
      Through ups and downs, Mitch never stopped giving his all to the city and its fans. From his first NHL goal to record-breaking assists, Mitch embodied dedication and perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Mitch’s greatest moments came in the playoffs of 2023, where his dazzling performances gave Leafs fans hope that the Stanley Cup drought would finally end. Even in the toughest losses, Mitch wore his heart on his sleeve, taking responsibility and standing tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marner also became one of the most beloved Leafs in history not just because of his points, but because of his character. His connection to the city was undeniable and will forever be remembered.

  <h3>Mitch Marner: Between Dreams and Frustration</h3>
  <p>
    Under the weight of another playoff heartbreak, Mitch Marner stood before the cameras—not just as a player, but as a symbol of a city’s endless hope. 
    <strong>"It sucks,"</strong> he admitted, his voice carrying the weight of years of unmet expectations. 
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet, despite the frustration, there was something deeper: <q><strong>"It’s frustrating."</strong></q> But behind that frustration was also pride—pride in wearing the jersey of his childhood dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interview: What's it mean to you be a Maple Leafs? 
    <blockquote>
      <em>“It’s mean everything... you know? maybe a risk pivk on a small kid from Toronto and I've been forever grategul to be able to wear this Maple Leafs and be a part of the some great legends an be able to wear this jersey. So, never taken a day for granted and i always loved”</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In this part of the interview, we can see Marner already talking in the past tense, rumors about him leaving Leasf always exist but before this he doesn't ressign his contract with Leafs [] .. 
    </p>

    That’s why it stings. Because this isn’t just work for him—it’s home. It’s love. It’s everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    He didn’t hide behind excuses: <strong>“It’s not good enough.”</strong> His words echoed not just through the press room, but in every corner of Toronto.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the city once again faces the weight of waiting, Mitch leaves us with a simple, painful truth: 
    <q>“It’s gonna take a bit to digest.”</q> 
  </p>
  <p>
    For Mitch. For the Leafs. For the fans. The dream is alive—but right now, it hurts.
